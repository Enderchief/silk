Gleam wrapper for the Erlang port of wxWidgets.

Note: silk is experimental and has not yet been completed.
The goal is to have an accurate mapping from built in Erlang functions to Gleam.

```sh
gleam add silk
```
```gleam
import silk

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```
